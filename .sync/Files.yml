# Specifies the files synced from Mu DevOps to other Project Mu repositories.
#
# This file is meant to ensure common configuration across Project Mu repos that is centralized in Mu DevOps.
#
# Files are contributed directly in Mu DevOps by the original author and then automatically synced after the PR
# in Mu DevOps is merged by UEFI Bot to all of the repos specified in this file.
#
# To maintain consistency across Project Mu, always consider if a configuration/settings file is appropriate as
# a common file in Mu DevOps or should be repo-specific.

# Azure Pipelines - Common Configs
#
# These files leverage a high degree of common build template reuse from Mu DevOps. It is preferred that repos
# use the common templates for pipelines and adjust template parameter inputs as needed for a specific repo. However,
# a repo can always be removed from this list and manage its pipeline YAML files completely independently if absolutely
# necessary.
#
# Note: The fact that these files are copied to a repo does not mean that the repo has pipelines
#       set up to use the YAML file. The file is simply available for pipelines to be connected
#       if needed.
